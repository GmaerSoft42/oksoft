# Security Policy

## The Policy

`Okmeque1/Software` has a strict "no viruses except where marked" policy which means that all programs are safe to use except the ones that are explicitely marked out as not being safe. Programs that deal with sensitive data such as [pwd.py](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/Utilities/pwd.py) do not retain any data or send it off to some random server, but rather saves it to a file. It is the owner's responsibility to ensure that the file is safely kept away from hackers through any means possible. If the owner wants to encrypt the file, we also provide solutions in our encryption suite in [Software/PythonSoft/Utilities](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/Utilities) such as [Encrypter-Decrypter.py](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/Utilities/Encrypter-Decrypter.py) and [pwd-hash_edition.py](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/Utilities/pwd-hash_edition.py). Please note they all require [Keygen.py](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/Utilities/keygen.py) to generate a valid Fernet key.

## Wait, there's a vulnerability that might cause a big data leak!

That's fine, because you can report it. If it's a major security vulnerability, you may contact me at "okmeque1.corporation@gmail.com". Please note that spam will be blocked. If it ain't a major vulnerability, you may submit an [issue
](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/issues), located under the word "Okmeque1".



Any changes you want to make to a program must be done through a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/pulls), located under the work "Software". This will be reviewed within a weeks time, but if your code is terrible, it will be rejected. Discussions may arise regarding your pull request.
