## doh!

Yes, some programs have vulnerabilities like how PWD doesn't encrypt before putting in variable, but really? Who's gonna go in your shell and see what password you have after it's printed? At this point might aswell be the FBI. Most programs don't spy or have telemetry on you, and anything that's marked as a prank or virus is clearly marked so if your computer conks out because you downloaded one of our pranks that's your fault for not reading the README, or the first 3 lines of code, or even the warning inside the programs?
