These programs have been written by me.Feel free to copy them with no restrictions! \n



Tho,before going on,please mention Okmeque1 in your program copy as so the original code does not get lost to time(like actually as copying someone else's hard work is not cool - Especially if it's a lone coder like me).




Don't assume I'm some software wizard,I just try to make programs with comfort features in them.
