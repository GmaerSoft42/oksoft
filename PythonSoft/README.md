# Read ME

## What's dis?

This is `/software/PythonSoft` where I put software that I want which will mostly be python stuff.My programs are NOTHING special and there are just better versions of programs that 
already exist.The names may be inaccurate for the program although I will try to organize it the best I can.

## Who Am I?

I'm Okmeque1,who used to be lone coder who does mostly stuff that already exists in my own fashion (like the way that passwords are saved is by having a set name written to a save file.)Don't ask me for specific needs as I do stuff on my own,no need for help there.

If you plan on updating my code,please make sure to include at the VERY start of the program who updated it,on what date and time and what changed and do **NOT** commit to the MAIN branch. Create a new branch for your code and start a **PULL REQUEST**, which is located under the word SOFTWARE. This is important as it allows collaborators to see what has changed and what can and needs to be changed. 

Before downloading any programs,MAKE SURE TO READ https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/LICENSE.md (aka license terms) for licensing of those programs.

For a short description of the program,see COMMIT log or https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/Programs.md

For upcoming and made updates,see https://github.com/Okmeque1/software/blob/main/PythonSoft/UPDATE.MD 

WARNING! The UPDATE.MD is not regularly updated and will NOT include small changes. Please refer to the commit log to see the full extent of my progress.

The programs listed above are not DESIGNED for commercial use but could be used for commercial use if needed.
